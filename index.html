  I was born and raised in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego" target="_blank">San Diego, California</a> , and I am 17 years old. I attend Canyon Crest Academy, where I enjoy learning and exploring new opportunities. I speak Chinese, which helps me connect with different cultures and people. Music is an important part of my life, and I have been playing the flute for several years. I like performing whenever I get the chance and sharing music with others. I would describe myself as curious, creative, and always eager to learn something new about the world around me.</p>


<h3>Things I Like</h3>

  In my free time, I enjoy <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/crosswords" target="_blank">crossword puzzles</a> and chess because they keep my mind active. I like watching movies and reading the news to stay informed. When I want to relax, I play video games or spend time with Pokémon. I also like going to the gym since it helps me stay healthy and feel energized. After a busy day, I really appreciate getting some extra sleep to recharge.</p>

<h3>Things I Don’t Like</h3>

  There are a few things I do not enjoy as much. Homework and studying can feel tedious, especially when the topic is not interesting to me. I also do not like cleaning or shopping very much. Reading boring books and sitting through dull classes are things I try to avoid when possible. Even though I know these tasks are necessary, I would always rather be doing something that feels <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clash_Royale" target="_blank">exciting or meaningful.</a>
